Project 3
=========

This project is from the Module 3 on machine learning and deep network winter school in MÃ¼rren.
In this project we applied machine learning methods for identification of birdsongs.
The jupyter notebook script of this project can be found `here <https://github.com/rjlopez2/ADS_CAS_Bern_2020/blob/main/Projects/M3/new_project/final_file-Copy1.ipynb>`_.

What were the challenges for this project?
------------------------------------------

- Can you build a classifier to identify birds based on their songs?
- Can you visualize the songs of specific birds?
- Can you generate new birdsongs based on this data?

Data Sources
------------

The inspiration was taken from a challenge posted in `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/>`_. The data was directly gathered from the site. For more information and details on the dataset visit the site `the original challenge site <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/british-birdsong-dataset>`_

How to reproduce this work?
---------------------------

Part of this work can be reproduced by downloading the `original dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/british-birdsong-dataset/download>`_. You may need to open an account in Kaggle to download the data.
Next, you will need to `download <https://github.com/rjlopez2/ADS_CAS_Bern_2020/blob/main/Projects/M3/new_project/final_file-Copy1.ipynb>`_ and run the jupyter notebook script in the same directory you download the dataset.
Have fun!
