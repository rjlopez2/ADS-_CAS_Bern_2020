Project 1 and 2
===============

These projects are from the Module 1 and Module 2 on data exploration and statistical inference.
The projects are about analysis of COVID-19 infection data.
The jupyter notebook script of this project can be found `here <https://github.com/rjlopez2/ADS_CAS_Bern_2020/blob/main/Projects/M1%20and%20M2/M1M2_cas_project.ipynb>`_ and the full report on the methodology can be found `here <https://github.com/rjlopez2/ADS_CAS_Bern_2020/blob/main/Projects/M1%20and%20M2/M1_Project_report.docx>`_.

What we did in this project?
----------------------------

- Extract, clean and combine valuable information of time series on up-to-date Covid cases reports, together with government stringency indicators and socioeconomic indicators from most countries around the world.
-	Visualize the current situation related to the pandemic dynamics worldwide.
-	Find correlation in the stringency indicators, socioeconomic indicator and the pandemic dynamics.
-	Identify patterns in countries with the best response against the pandemic outbreak.
